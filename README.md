## IG Visualiser

App that enables you to display key data and metrics from an instagram chat (designed for group chats!)

To use, download data from Instagram (explanation found within IG Visualiser page) and add it to the website

None of this data is uploaded to a server, the website just parses the JSON file and presents the information.
